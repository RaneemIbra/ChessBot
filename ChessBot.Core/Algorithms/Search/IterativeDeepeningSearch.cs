/*
 * IterativeDeepeningSearch.cs
 * 
 * Summary:
 *   This file implements the IterativeDeepeningSearch class, which uses an iterative deepening
 *   strategy to determine the best move within a given time constraint. The search starts at depth 1 
 *   and incrementally increases the search depth until either the maximum depth is reached or the 
 *   allocated move time (in milliseconds) expires. An aspiration window is used to narrow the alphaâ€“beta 
 *   search bounds for efficiency. If the evaluation falls outside the aspiration window, the search 
 *   is re-run with full bounds. The best move found so far is returned when time runs out or the search 
 *   completes.
 * 
 * Usage:
 *   - Call GetBestMove by providing the current board state, the root player's color, the maximum search 
 *     depth, and the move time limit in milliseconds.
 *   - The method returns the best move computed within the allotted time.
