# Pawn Game Agent

Pawn Game Agent is a C# project that implements an AI agent for playing a game of pawns. This project includes two executable files:

- **Local Play Executable**: Play against the AI agent locally.
- **Server Connection Executable**: Connect the agent to a server to compete with other agents.

Additionally, the complete source code is provided, allowing you to run the project directly from Visual Studio using the run button.

## Overview

Pawn Game Agent is designed to showcase a C# AI that plays the game of pawns. The project supports two modes of operation: a local play mode and a server-connected mode, offering flexibility for both casual play and competitive agent-versus-agent matches.

  - **Local Play**: Launch a game against the AI agent with a simple double-click.
  - **Server Connection**: Connect to a server and engage in multiplayer or agent-vs-agent gameplay.
- **No Terminal Required**: Both executables are user-friendly and require only a click to start.
